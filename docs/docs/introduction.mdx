Skittles lets you write blockchain smart contracts using TypeScript — the language you already know. No new syntax to learn. Just write classes, use the types and features you're familiar with, and Skittles handles all the blockchain complexity for you.

## What is a Smart Contract?

If you're new to blockchain development, here's what you need to know:

A **smart contract** is a program that runs on a blockchain (like Ethereum). Once deployed, it can hold funds, enforce rules, and execute automatically without any middleman.

Think of it like a vending machine:
- You put money in (send cryptocurrency)
- The contract follows its programmed rules
- You get something out (tokens, NFTs, or any other outcome)
- No middleman needed — it all happens automatically and transparently on the blockchain

Smart contracts are used to build decentralized applications (dApps) like token systems, NFT marketplaces, DeFi protocols, and much more.

```typescript title="contracts/Token.ts"
import { address, msg, SkittlesEvent, Indexed } from "skittles";

export class Token {
  Transfer: SkittlesEvent<{
    from: Indexed<address>;
    to: Indexed<address>;
    value: number;
  }>;

  name: string = "My Token";
  symbol: string = "TKN";
  totalSupply: number = 0;
  balances: Record<address, number> = {};

  constructor(initialSupply: number) {
    this.totalSupply = initialSupply;
    this.balances[msg.sender] = initialSupply;
  }

  transfer(to: address, amount: number): boolean {
    if (this.balances[msg.sender] < amount) {
      throw new Error("Insufficient balance");
    }
    this.balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    this.balances[to] += amount;
    this.Transfer.emit({ from: msg.sender, to, value: amount });
    return true;
  }
}
```

This contract creates a simple token with balances and transfers. The `balances` Record keeps track of how many tokens each address owns. The `transfer` method lets users send tokens to each other, checking that they have enough balance first. The `Transfer` event logs every transfer that happens, which is important for tracking activity on the blockchain.

## Why Skittles?

**You write TypeScript** — the language you already know. No need to learn Solidity syntax, memory keywords, or blockchain-specific quirks.

**You get full IDE support** — autocomplete, type checking, go-to-definition, and refactoring all work out of the box. Your editor understands your contracts just like any other TypeScript code.

**Skittles handles the blockchain complexity** — automatic type conversions, visibility rules, state mutability, gas optimizations, and all the low-level details are managed for you.

**Your contracts are tested with familiar tools** — use Hardhat and Mocha/Chai for testing, the same tools TypeScript developers use for other projects. No special testing frameworks to learn.

## Features

- **Familiar types**: Use `number` for amounts and counters, `string` for text, `boolean` for flags, `address` for wallet addresses, `bytes` for raw data, `Record<K,V>` or `Map<K,V>` for key-value storage, arrays, type aliases for custom structures, interfaces, and enums
- **Class properties** become persistent state variables — use `public`, `private`, `readonly`, and `static readonly` just like in TypeScript
- **Methods** work like you expect — automatic optimizations detect if your function only reads data or modifies state, `virtual`/`override` for inheritance, getters/setters, plus special `receive()` and `fallback()` for handling payments
- **Events** let you log activity on the blockchain — use `SkittlesEvent<T>` with `Indexed<T>` to mark searchable parameters
- **Custom errors** for better error messages — use `SkittlesError<T>` or extend the `Error` class
- **Inheritance** with `extends` and `super` — build modular, reusable contracts
- **Control flow** — all the standard JavaScript patterns work: `if`/`else`, `for`, `while`, `do`/`while`, `for...of`, `switch`/`case`, ternary operators
- **Operators** — arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`), comparison, logical, bitwise, and compound assignment operators all work as expected
- **Blockchain globals** — access `msg.sender` (who called your function), `msg.value` (how much they sent), `block.timestamp`, `block.number`, `tx.origin`, and more
- **Built-in functions** — `keccak256()`, `sha256()`, `ecrecover()`, `abi.encode()`, `abi.encodePacked()` for cryptographic operations and data encoding
- **Multi-file projects** — share types, constants, and functions across contract files
- **Fast incremental builds** — SHA256-based caching only recompiles what changed

## Build Output

When you compile your TypeScript contracts, Skittles generates:

```
build/
  solidity/     # Generated contract source code
```

Run `npx skittles` to compile your contracts, then use Hardhat to test and deploy them. Everything works with standard Ethereum tools like ethers.js, viem, and Foundry.

## Under the Hood

<details>
<summary>How does Skittles work? (Click to expand)</summary>

Under the hood, Skittles compiles your TypeScript to Solidity source code. This is great because:

- **Auditable** — Security professionals can review the generated Solidity code
- **Verifiable** — You can verify your contracts on Etherscan and other block explorers
- **Compatible** — Works with every EVM tool and deployment platform
- **Transparent** — The generated Solidity is human-readable and available in `build/solidity/`

The compilation happens in three stages:
1. Parse your TypeScript with the official TypeScript compiler
2. Generate optimized Solidity code with proper types and visibility
3. Output clean, readable Solidity source files
